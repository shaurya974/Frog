previously i have added levels in the game but it somehow i felt is muddling the game so i removed it 
firstly i had thouught to add game elements through google and iteraitng over it but i changed my mind later and coded it all from bullets to frog to every other sprites you can see through the game
for music as usual from a free site and is cool too 
and for accurate measurements of the sprits  i used chatgpt 
used libraries --- pygame and random 
you can further tweak the game as you like
